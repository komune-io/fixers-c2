## SSM  


In a blockchain, smart-contracts are programs designed to implement a transaction between several parties. Smart-contracts are usually written in programming languages such as Solidity for Ethereum, Golang (Go) or Node.js for Hyperledger fabric based blockchains, or almost about any language according to the underlying blockchain implementation.   
A Signing State Machine (SSM) is a smart contract written with a more constrained paradigm than plain programming languages, based on a finite state automaton.
