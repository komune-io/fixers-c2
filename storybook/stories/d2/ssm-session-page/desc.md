# Session  


While an [SSM](/docs/chaincode-dsl-signing-state-machine--page#ssm) purely describes the structure of a State Machine, a session represents its instantiation. It defines which [agent](/docs/chaincode-dsl-agent--page#ssmagent) is assigned to which role, and keeps track of every state transition it has undergone.
